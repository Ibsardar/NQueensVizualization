# NQueensVizualization
N-Queens Solver Visualization using the Gosu gem in Ruby. This is an assignment for Artificial Intelligence where we could pick any language to create a program that solves 8-Queens and (extra credit) N-Queens. If you read the readme, you will notice that N-Queens is run via terminal/powershell, while 8-Queens is already packed for you in a '.exe' file.

#### Please refer to the README.txt if you wish to run the N-Queens Solver.

Otherwise, just download and run 8queens.rb for a randomized 8-Queens Solver.
